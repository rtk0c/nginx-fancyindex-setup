<div class="readme">
    <h1>Hello! this is an example custom footer</h1>
    <p>You can write content in this file. It will be concatenated directly to the bottom of the page, so anything goes, even JavaScript. Or <b>formatting</b> like <i>these</i>.</p>
    <p>Notice that the subfolder <code>Folder/</code> doesn't have a README.html. If that's the case, there will just be a blank footer. (Or rather <code>/.fancyindex/defaultFooter.html</code> is used, which is empty; you can change that if you want.)</p>
</div>
